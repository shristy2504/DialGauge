# DialGauge

Calibration of Dial Gauge – Internship Project 

Overview:
This repository documents the work I completed during my summer internship at India Optel Limited, specifically within the Metrological Service Department (Unit E28). The project focused on calibrating a plunger-type dial gauge using a high-precision Length Measuring Machine (LMM) with a least count of 0.0001 mm and a range of 300 mm.
The goal was to check and validate the accuracy of the dial gauge under controlled environmental conditions—ensuring it meets industrial metrology standards. I worked through the full process: from setup and alignment to detailed measurement and error analysis.


What This Project Includes :
* Basics of dial indicators and types (plunger, lever, digital)
* Step-by-step calibration workflow
* Environmental setup (maintaining 22°C ± 2°C and 40–60% humidity)
* Observation table and deviation analysis
* Final conclusion on gauge performance and calibration validity
This process ensures the gauge can be trusted for precision inspections in manufacturing or quality control for at least a year.


Tools & Equipment Used :
* Plunger-type Dial Indicator
* Length Measuring Machine (LMM)
* Temperature & Humidity Monitoring Instruments
* Calibration Sheets & Accuracy Charts


My Role During the Internship:
As a summer intern at India Optel Limited, I was fortunate to get hands-on experience with precision metrology equipment. Here’s what I did:
* Learned the basics of metrology and gauge standards — especially how different dial indicators work
* Prepared the lab environment — monitored and maintained temperature and humidity for reliable results
* Mounted and aligned instruments — secured the dial gauge onto the LMM and ensured perfect vertical alignment
* Took multiple readings — measured the gauge at various points, forward and reverse, to check for errors and repeatability
* Analyzed data — calculated deviations, compared them with standards, and confirmed that all values were within allowable limits


The dial gauge was successfully calibrated and certified for use until June 2026, showing only minor deviations (max 7.7 microns) — well within accepted accuracy limits.
This internship gave me practical insight into calibration processes, the importance of environmental control, and how even the smallest measurements can impact precision engineering. It also helped me understand the real-world application of what we learn in the classroom.
